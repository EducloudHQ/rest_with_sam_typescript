## Conclusion
In this course, we learnt how to create a CRUDL Serverless api with API gateway, AWS SAM and typescript.

We saw a brief overview of the SAM anatomy and also saw how to approach 
api development from an Infrastructure as Code perspective.

We also, used the Typescrip Software Development Kit to implement lambda handlers for our apis.

There's still a lot to learn with respect to serverless api development. 

Hope you learnt a thing or two in this one, and we'll be glad to get any feedback.

There are a lot more SAM courses on this platform, do check them out and step 
your game up. 

As always, leave any questions in the QA section, and we'll do our best to provide all 
necessary assistance.

Happy Coding
