After creating the `WeatherTable`, let's create the weather api resource
which adds methods that can be invoked through HTTPS endpoints.

In the `template.yaml` file, under `Resources`, add the following yaml code

```yaml
  WeatherApi:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Api
    Properties:
      StageName: dev
      Description: serverless api for weather application

```
`WeatherApi` is the logical id for our api.
`AWS::Serverless::Api` is the type of api(Api gateway)

For properties, we have the `StageName` set to `dev` and `Description` of the api. 

This is enough for our simple api. If you need to enhance the api further, please 
check-out the complete api gateway properties [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-resource-api.html).

Here's how our `template.yaml` file looks like now.

```yaml

AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
Description: >
