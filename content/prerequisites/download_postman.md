In this course, we will be using Postman to test our endpoint.

Postman is an application used for API testing. It is an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests, utilizing a graphical user interface, through which we obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated.

You can download Postman as a desktop app (available for Linux, Windows 10, or MacOsX) or web application from [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) .
